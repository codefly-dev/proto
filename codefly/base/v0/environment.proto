/*
Environment is a fundamental building block in your system. It represents a specific setup where your services or modules run.

Each environment has a unique name, a description, and a load balancer. The load balancer distributes network traffic across multiple servers to ensure that no single server bears too much demand.

This allows for maximum speed and availability. The load balancer should be specified by its unique identifier.
